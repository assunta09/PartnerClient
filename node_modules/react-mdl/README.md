# [React-MDL][react-mdl-url] [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url]

React-MDL is a set of React components build on top of [Material Design Lite][google-mdl-url] v1.2.1

Join the #react-mdl channel of the [Reactiflux Discord][discord-url] community.

## Requirements
Instead of using the official `material.css` and `material.js` files from the MDL project, you should use the files we provide in [/extra](/extra/). The reason to that is because the official `Layout` component is not fully compatible with React. We made a patch and we re-exported everything so people can still use it.
If you're worried about the changes we made, you can take a look at the [patch note](/extra/layout-patch.diff) or read about the issue in [this ticket](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/issues/1356).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="material.css">
<script src="material.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

### Create React App

The above instructions wonâ€™t work if you use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with `react-scripts` higher than `0.4.0`.  
If you use it, add only this one line to your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

Then add these lines to `src/index.js`:

```js
import 'react-mdl/extra/material.css';
import 'react-mdl/extra/material.js';
```

## Installation

`npm install --save react-mdl`


## Usage

You can use React-MDL through a bundler like [webpack][webpack-url] or [browserify][browserify-url] by importing `react-mdl` in your application:

```js
import { Button, Card, CardText } from 'react-mdl';

// or...
import Button from 'react-mdl/lib/Button';
import { Card, CardText, CardActions } from 'react-mdl/lib/Card';
```

Alternatively, you can include `node_modules/react-mdl/out/ReactMDL.js` as a script, but you'll likely want to copy it to a folder outside of `node_modules` first, such as `lib` or `vendor`. Then a global `ReactMDL` will be available:

```js
const { Button, Card, CardText } = ReactMDL;
```
